# ImGuiRedux_Cleo_GTASADE
an ImGui menu made using ImGuiRedux for Cleo Redux for the game GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition

I use Rockstar Games version of the game, don't know if it works on Steam. You can try. I think it might work since Cleo already added support for Steam versions a while ago. Any virus hits are false positives. If it doesn't let you download due to virus hit, alternatively, you can just click on "imgui_gta_sa_de.js" and copy all the source code, create a new .js file in your CLEO folder and paste all the source code in it. Or just turn your antivirus off, but I guess people don't really wanna turn their AV off.

**Usage**

To use, simply copy/paste all files in zip folder to CLEO folder for your game. So copy/paste "imgui_gta_sa_de.js" and "data" to your CLEO folder (C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas - Definitive Edition\Gameface\Binaries\Win64\CLEO). You will also need an ASI Loader "version.dll" which automatically gets put in the Win64 folder when you install Cleo Redux to game directory location. 

**Hotkeys**

Insert - Toggle the ImGui menu on or off

F1 - Warp to last created vehicle

F2 - Repair last created vehicle

F3 - Delete last created vehicle
