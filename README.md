# ImGuiRedux_Cleo_GTA_SA_DE
an ImGui menu made using ImGuiRedux for Cleo Redux for the game GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition

I use Rockstar Games version of the game, don't know if it works on Steam. You can try. I think it might work since Cleo already added support for Steam versions a while ago. Any virus hits are false positives. If it doesn't let you download due to virus hit, alternatively, you can just click on "imgui_gta_sa_de.js" and copy all the source code, create a new .js file in your CLEO folder and paste all the source code in it. Or just turn your antivirus off, but I guess people don't really wanna turn their AV off. You should still be able to earn achievements while using this, to my knowledge. I made this mod so you can easily search a vehicle/vehicle color within a menu instead of pressing hotkey and going through all vehicles to get to your desired vehicle. Apparently ImGuiRedux has some bugs, not sure why but if you open the menu and expand lists while inside buildings, it will become buggy. Simply, step outside the building and then use this.

**Usage:**

To use, simply copy/paste all files in zip folder to CLEO folder for your game. So copy/paste "imgui_gta_sa_de.js", "data" and "CLEO_PLUGINS" to your CLEO folder (C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas - Definitive Edition\Gameface\Binaries\Win64\CLEO). You will need an ASI Loader "version.dll" which automatically gets put in the Win64 folder when you install Cleo Redux to game directory location. And yes, you need to install Cleo Redux too which you can do here: https://re.cleo.li/

**Hotkeys:**

Insert - Toggle the ImGui menu on or off

F1 - Warp to last created vehicle

F2 - Repair last created vehicle

F3 - Delete last created vehicle
